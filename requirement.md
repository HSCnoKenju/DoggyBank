# User requirement
* Set one total value (commitment) at the start of the month which can't be modified during the commitment time.
* Each time that the end-user spend something he would registry that transaction in the app and see the spendable money go down of the same value.
* The value can be negative, and if so the interface will became "uglier"
* To set the initial value, the end-user can put it manually, or make some calculation based off the model described on "A dog named Money" :
    * Input all the money you earnt this month
    * exclude the fixed life's cost (home loan, taxes, bills)
    * on the subtotal, enstabilish in percentage how much you want to save, how much you are willing to invest, and how much you want to spend the following month
    * take the percentage of what you want to spend times you subtotal as the starting value
* Shortcut, choose the same value of the last month
* Track you own score, see how you performed the past months
    * basic : track only if you successfully managed to stay inside the self boundary you made
    * extended : also track how much you differed from the goal (positivly or negativly)
        * may lead to a philosofy or a stress to spend the LEAST possbile(?), but it is useful when you are always going off the budget to show you the progress toward the goal value
